Association rules for discovering regularities between products in large  scale  transaction  data  recorded  by  point-of-sale  (POS)  systems  in  supermarkets.  For  example, the rule {onion,potatoes}=>{burger} found in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together, he or she is likely to also buy burger. Such information can be used as the basis for decisions about marketing activities such as, e.g., promotional pricing or product placements. In addition to the above example from market basket analysis association rules are employed today in many application areas including Web usage mining, intrusion detection and bioinformatics.

Hashing technique significantly improves the time and quality of results obtained containing not only frequent but significant assosciation between items.
Followinf algorithms have been implemented to find frequent itemsets:

1)MultiHash Algorithm
2)PCY
3)Toivonen
